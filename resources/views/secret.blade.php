        <p>
            Now that you found the file and navigated to unindexed page, I would like you to give bit of your time to vent.
            While this is a bit unprofessional to do in a project, I feel like some people have to hear the truth.
            I did initially wanted to be more serious with project and started to make it using already existing HTML components.
            While this has fullfilled my needs for most part, I stumbled upon issue where I realized some UI compontents from external libraries
            would be better to use than ones availble in standard HTML. So I looked into one of the native options which is
            <span><a href="https://fluxui.dev/pricing" class="hover:underline decoration-2"><strong>FluxUI.</strong></a></span>
            However looking at the pay gated components and pricing model for it left a sour taste in my mouth.

            I did already spend quiet few of my labor hours into making website look nice, and it would take considerable time to
            learn Vue or React and refactor everything to work with said frontend frameworks. I understand that finding work is hard
            and everyone needs to pay their bills, but it cannot come at cost of your customer base. Even TailwindUI pricing seems
            a lot more fair and reasonable. Locking elements like Accordion behind paywall which are freely available on UI libraries
            such as NuxtUI for Vue seem to be highly out of touch and should he reconsidered. Programming should not be available for
            only select few, but should be accessible to as many people as possible in same way art is.

            P.S: This was written in VSCode which has no word check, so rant will have probably lot of gramatical errors which I am really sorry about.
